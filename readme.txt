Creates a flexible, secure contact form on your WP site

== Description ==

A well-coded, secure, and flexible WordPress plugin that makes creating contact (and other) forms very simple. This is meant to be a simple tool for both savvy WordPress users and seasoned WordPress developers. 

At the moment, this plugins creates a contact form with the shortcode `[proper_contact_form]` that works on any page. Users have the option to:

- Choose the fields that appear
- Create an auto-respond email
- Redirect contact submissions to a new page (helpful for goal tracking)
- Store contacts in the admin
- Over-ride label names

The current, basic functionality will not change but, in a future version, WP users will be able to add custom forms with validation quickly and easily.
