Creates a flexible, secure contact form on your WP site

== Description ==

A well-coded, secure, and (soon to be very) flexible WordPress plugin that makes creating contact (and other) forms very simple. This is meant to be a simple tool for both savvy WordPress users and seasoned WordPress developers. 

At the moment, this simply creates a contact form with the shortcode [proper_contact_form]. There is a settings page to tinker with a few of the options, and allows you to validate and submit to a new page to help with goal tracking in analytics.

The current, basic functionality will not change but, in a future version, WP users will be able to add custom forms with validation quickly and easily.

== Installation ==

Activating the Proper Contact Form plugin is just like any other plugin. If you've uploaded the plugin package to your server already, skip to step 5 below:

1. In your WordPress admin, go to **Plugins > Add New**
2. In the Search field type "proper contact platform"
3. Under "Proper Contact Platform," click the **Install Now** link
4. Once the process is complete, click the **Activate Plugin** link
5. Now, you're able to add contact forms but, first, we could configure a few settings. These can be found at **Settings > Proper Contact**
6. Make the changes desired, then click the **Save changes** button at the bottom
7. To add this form to any page or post, just copy/paste or type "[proper_contact_form]" into the page or post content and save. The form should appear on that page
